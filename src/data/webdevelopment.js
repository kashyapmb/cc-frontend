		content:
			"Web development has come a long way since its inception, and one tool that has made a significant impact is Chrome DevTools. It has revolutionized how web developers, QAs, and backend developers develop, test & debug web apps. Today, you can't imagine building web apps without access to Chrome Devtools. It provides complete visibility into what's happening inside your web application, from the HTML DOM at any given point to the network requests your app fired.",

		content:
			"The slice method in JavaScript is used to extract a portion of an array or string. It takes two parameters: the start index and the end index. The start index specifies the index where the extraction should begin, and the end index specifies the index where the extraction should end (but not including the end index itself). The slice method does not modify the original array or string. Instead, it returns a new array or string that contains the extracted portion.",

		content:
			"The CSS can be used in three ways to design HTML tags, elements as well attributes i.e Inline, Internal, and External Style. Three of them have their own uses and requirements. But who is the first on the priority list when three of the methods will be implemented to specifically target the same tag in HTML? This concept can be understood properly by performing practically in ID. For instance when we use both internal and external style methods to target the same tag.",
